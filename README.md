# Sorting Algorithms and Binary Search Tree Implementation in JavaScript

This project implements sorting and search algorithms (Binary Search Tree) in JavaScript. I have created algorithm functions to use in your projects.

## Features

- **Insertion Sort:** Sorts an array by iterating through each element and placing it in its correct position. It's a simple yet effective sorting algorithm.
- **Merge Sort:** Utilizes the divide and conquer approach to split an array in half, recursively sort both halves, and merge the sorted results. It's efficient for large datasets.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A data structure where each node's left subtree contains values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node's value. It allows fast search and sorted data retrieval.

### Usage

1. Clone or download the project.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ozcanbatuhan/algorithms.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd algorithms
    ```

3. Run the function that you need to use in your project.
